# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Basic preparation of project and workspace: deciding which project & where to start, reviewing rules, setting up environment for both my project and updates for 100-days-of-code.

**Thoughts:** Glad to finally be getting started. It seems I've forgotten (or can't easily recall) so much of what I've studied that past few months.

---

### Day 2: September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Needed to move the physical location of my repository, so had to figure out what was involved in that. Spent most of the time looking working some things out on Git and Github. Also had some issues with the initial compilation of the default code in Android Studio.

**Thoughts:** Frustrating having to spend so much time "relearning" things I've done with git. As I think about it though, there've been a lot of delays since when I learned it initially and when I'm now getting a chance to use it.

---

### Day 3: September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started by learning some about Markdown syntax. Haven't used it before. Had to do some significant updating to VSC.

**Thoughts:** Wish I was on to working more on a specific project, but learning more about various ancillary tools is also important.

---

### Day 4: September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked more on getting a handle on git/github. Found a couple of open-source projects that are simliar (but much more advanced) than what I'm wanting to work on. These should be good to study.

**Thoughts:** Feels like I'm starting to get my bearings--at least with some of the tools.

---

### Day 5: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Forked, cloned, and opened sample app code in Android Studio (that took a while). Started getting a basic layout of the home screen of an app.

**Thoughts:** Need to get some more dedicated time to getting this moving. An hour can go by quickly--especially when you keep having to download missing items and wait for compiling.

---

### Day 6: September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Searched for Miwok app for reference--couldn't find it. Added new actiity for second page and wrote introduction.

**Thoughts:** It's disturbing how much I've forgotten over the past couple of months of not working on this. Hopefully it will mostly come back.

---

### Day 7: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Spent some time searching for data for a possible quiz program for Medicare AHIP. Finished the time working on the strings and layout for the start page.

**Thoughts:** Enjoying getting in to using Android Studio again--to the small extent I'm used to it.

---

### Day 8: September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on setting an onClickListener and intent on a button.

**Thoughts:** Moving slowly, but moving.

---

### Day 9: September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got the buttons working. Still need to have them call up the other activity.

**Thoughts:** It was nice to track down the problem.

---

### Day 10: September 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Was able to get the activity to change on the button press. A couple of issues, but the main thing was adding the new activity to the Manifest.

**Thoughts:** Good again to be able to sort out the problem myself. Slow progress, but not spending much time on it either.

---

### Day 11: September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got second activity and button working. Figured out, mostly, which of the various previous changes I made were actually necessary. Updated homescreen text. Messed w/ using version control inside of Android Studio. Later changed older ActionBar to newer Toolbar, and set these up on all three Activities.

**Thoughts:** Nice having more time; making more progress; and doing something new as oppossed to just relearning old things. Confidence builder.

---

### Day 12: September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** No coding today. Was at The Google Cloud Summit in Seattle all day.

**Thoughts:** Close enough.

---

### Day 13: September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on adding an overflow menu to the Toolbar. Having trouble getting the icon(s) sorted out. Need to revisit that.

**Thoughts:** Pretty straightforward.

---

### Day 14: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Updated Git for Windows. Worked on figuring out how to get the help and overflow menu to appear on the toolbar. Not there yet.

**Thoughts:** Very tired from a long day, but managed to do a little.

---

### Day 15: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Missed four days. We had company from out of town. Started a new Android course. Came up with a couple of apps that I'll develope as I move through the course.

**Thoughts:** Sorry for the break in the 100 days, but it made sense.

---

### Day 16: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continuing on with Android course. Started 3rd personal project to do alongside course. Figured out some very basic initial designs.

**Thoughts:** Eager to make some progress.

---

### Day 17: September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added a Basic Activity from a template to a project so that I can use it as a reference to build a menu.

**Thoughts:** Nice to have some reference code to look at.

---

### Day 18: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Nothing much so far. Created a seperate project for testing different code as I go along.

**Thoughts:** Hmm.

---

### Day 19: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Didn't get anything done yesterday (Sunday). Today, while working on the course, I added a login screen input text layout and button.

**Thoughts:** It is nice doing the same task a least a couple of times after learning it.

---

### Day 20: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Well, I've been away from this for a few days--some of that out of town at the Lake House. Spent most of the time reviewing the files and file structure of a fully developed Task app to give myself an idea of what a full app looks like.

**Thoughts:** Mixed. Overwhelming to have so many files, folders, and lines of code. It's not all completely indecipherable for me, so that is good. More, particularly of the files/folders make sense to me now.

---

### Day 21: October 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on scraping some web data w/ Jsoup. 

**Thoughts:** Made some progress, but I think all the requirements to do this in an app are beyond my ability at this point.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
