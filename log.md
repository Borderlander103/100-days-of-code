# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Basic preparation of project and workspace: deciding which project & where to start, reviewing rules, setting up environment for both my project and updates for 100-days-of-code.

**Thoughts:** Glad to finally be getting started. It seems I've forgotten (or can't easily recall) so much of what I've studied that past few months.

### Day 2: September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Needed to move the physical location of my repository, so had to figure out what was involved in that. Spent most of the time looking working some things out on Git and Github. Also had some issues with the initial compilation of the default code in Android Studio.

**Thoughts:** Frustrating having to spend so much time "relearning" things I've done with git. As I think about it though, there've been a lot of delays since when I learned it initially and when I'm now getting a chance to use it.

### Day 3: September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started by learning some about Markdown syntax. Haven't used it before. Had to do some significant updating to VSC.

**Thoughts:** Wish I was on to working more on a specific project, but learning more about various ancillary tools is also important.

### Day 4: September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked more on getting a handle on git/github. Found a couple of open-source projects that are simliar (but much more advanced) than what I'm wanting to work on. These should be good to study.

**Thoughts:** Feels like I'm starting to get my bearings--at least with some of the tools.

### Day 5: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Forked, cloned, and opened sample app code in Android Studio (that took a while). Started getting a basic layout of the home screen of an app.

**Thoughts:** Need to get some more dedicated time to getting this moving. An hour can go by quickly--especially when you keep having to download missing items and wait for compiling.

### Day 6: September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Searched for Miwok app for reference--couldn't find it. Added new actiity for second page and wrote introduction.

**Thoughts:** It's disturbing how much I've forgotten over the past couple of months of not working on this. Hopefully it will mostly come back.

---

### Day 7: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Spent some time searching for data for a possible quiz program for Medicare AHIP. Finished the time working on the strings and layout for the start page.

**Thoughts:** Enjoying getting in to using Android Studio again--to the small extent I'm used to it.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
