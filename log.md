# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Basic preparation of project and workspace: deciding which project & where to start, reviewing rules, setting up environment for both my project and updates for 100-days-of-code.

**Thoughts:** Glad to finally be getting started. It seems I've forgotten (or can't easily recall) so much of what I've studied that past few months.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
